            <p>
                Founded in 2025, our mission is to make sustainable living simple, stylish, and accessible to everyone. We were created for people who care about the planet, but also care about comfort, convenience, and good design. Instead of asking you to completely change your lifestyle, we focus on small, realistic shifts that fit naturally into your daily routine. We believe sustainability shouldn’t feel like a sacrifice or a luxury — it should feel normal, achievable, and open to anyone, no matter where they’re starting from.

                Our mission is to close the gap between “wanting to live greener” and actually knowing what to do about it. That means making eco-conscious choices feel less confusing, less overwhelming, and a lot more enjoyable. Through clear messaging, thoughtful design, and everyday-friendly solutions, we aim to turn good intentions into simple habits that last. At EcoSip, we believe that when sustainable options are easy to understand, easy to use, and easy to love, more people will choose them — and that’s how real change begins.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started with a single idea — to reduce single-use plastic waste by creating durable, reusable drinkware
                that people actually love to use. Every EcoSip product is thoughtfully designed to blend functionality
                with eco-conscious craftsmanship.

            <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
            <p class="ceo-name">Alex Tan - Founder & CEO</p>

            <p>
                Alex Tan founded EcoSip in 2025 with a simple but powerful belief: meaningful change doesn’t always
                begin with grand gestures — it often starts with the small objects we use every single day. Growing up
                near the coast, Alex saw how quickly plastic waste could pile up on beaches and in parks, even when
                communities believed they were “recycling enough.” Those early experiences sparked a question that never
                really went away: what if the things we use every day were designed to protect the places we love, instead
                of harming them?
            </p>

            <p>
                Before launching EcoSip, Alex studied design and worked on consumer products for several years. During that
                time, they saw how many items were created to be convenient rather than lasting — cheaply made, quickly
                discarded, and easily replaced. The more Alex learned about how much energy, water, and raw material went
                into producing single-use drinkware, the clearer it became that there had to be a better model. Instead of
                contributing to a cycle of “use and throw,” Alex wanted to build products that people would feel proud to
                keep, repair, and reuse for years.
            </p>

            <p>
                EcoSip was born from the idea that sustainability and style should never be in conflict. Under Alex's
                leadership, every bottle, cup, and tumbler begins with a simple question: <em>“Would someone love this
                enough to use it every day?”</em> From the curvature of the handle to the weight of the lid, Alex works
                closely with designers and suppliers to make sure each detail feels thoughtful and intentional. The goal
                isn't only to remove plastic from landfills and oceans — it's to create a daily experience that quietly
                reminds people that their choices matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                As CEO, Alex believes that transparency and education are just as important as great design. They are
                deeply involved in decisions about materials, sourcing, and manufacturing, always pushing for options
                that are safer for both people and the environment. Alex often says that EcoSip is not just a drinkware
                brand, but a learning space — a place where customers can discover why bamboo, stainless steel, and glass
                are better options, and how small habits like refilling a bottle can add up over months and years. This
                mindset shapes everything from product descriptions to packaging and community campaigns.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of Alex's core priorities is building honest relationships with suppliers and partners. EcoSip works
                with manufacturers who share the same values around fair labour, responsible production, and long-term
                quality. Alex spends time visiting workshops, asking uncomfortable questions, and looking for ways to
                reduce waste at every stage of the process — not just at the final product. For Alex, sustainability is
                not a single feature; it is a continuous commitment to doing better, step by step.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside the company, Alex leads with the same values that shaped EcoSip's mission. The team is encouraged
                to question processes, suggest improvements, and bring new ideas to the table, no matter their role or
                seniority. Alex believes that good ideas can come from anyone, and that a culture of listening is essential
                for a company that wants to create positive change. Team meetings often include open discussions about new
                sustainability goals, customer feedback, and even mistakes that EcoSip can learn from.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond the office, Alex regularly speaks at schools, community groups, and local events about climate
                action and conscious consumption. Rather than focusing on guilt or perfection, Alex shares practical,
                realistic steps that people can take in their everyday lives. Their message is simple: you don't have to
                change everything overnight. Start with one reusable bottle, one cup you carry everywhere, one habit you
                can proudly call your own — and let that be the beginning, not the end, of your sustainability journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under Alex's leadership, EcoSip has set clear goals for the future. These include exploring new materials
                with even lower environmental footprints, expanding refill partnerships with local cafés and businesses,
                and supporting clean-up and education projects in communities around the world. Alex also hopes to launch
                programmes that make high-quality reusable drinkware more accessible to students and young people, so that
                sustainable habits can begin early and last a lifetime.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alex often measures success in stories rather than numbers. For them, the most meaningful moments are when
                a customer writes in to say that EcoSip helped them stop buying plastic bottles, or when a student shares
                that a school presentation inspired them to bring their own tumbler every day. These small shifts may not
                make headlines, but they are exactly the kind of quiet, consistent change that Alex believes will shape
                the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking ahead, Alex's vision for EcoSip is simple but ambitious: to prove that businesses can grow while
                still honouring the planet and the people who live on it. That means designing fewer, better products instead
                of chasing endless trends, and staying honest about the company's impact — both the progress made and the
                work still to be done. EcoSip will continue to evolve, but Alex is determined that one thing will never
                change: the belief that every refill is a small act of hope for what the world can become.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Alex, EcoSip is more than a brand or a job. It is a promise — to the beaches that first sparked their
                concern, to the customers who choose to reuse, and to the next generation who will inherit the results of
                today's decisions. Every time someone lifts an EcoSip cup or bottle, they are part of that promise. And in
                Alex's eyes, that is the real achievement: not just how many products are sold, but how many people feel
                empowered to live a little more gently on the Earth, one sip at a time.
